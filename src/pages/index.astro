  <h1>Ezaz Ahmed</h1>
  <small>Software Engineer</small>
  <strong>
    While sipping coffee, I love working on software that contributes to making
    the world a better place. JavaScript is my superpower, empowering me to
    bring innovative solutions to life.
  </strong>

  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a seasoned web developer skilled in TypeScript and JavaScript, dedicated
    to crafting visually stunning and high-performing web applications. I'm
    committed to excellence, translating imaginative ideas into innovative
    designs. My focus is on creating websites that excel in both aesthetics and
    functionality. I actively contribute to open-source projects and
    continuously seek new knowledge to fuel my creativity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides coding, I enjoy mentoring, exploring startup concepts, and delving
    into serverless and functional programming. I'm deeply curious about
    cybersecurity and ethical hacking. Let's talk about developer experience,
    anime, or startup ideas â€“ I'm always open to stimulating conversations! Oh,
    and I make a mean cup of coffee too!
